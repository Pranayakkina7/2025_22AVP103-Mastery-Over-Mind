## Journal Record
Gratitude Journal

Three people I am grateful for at amrita

Date: 11/11/2025

Hey, I'm Pranay Akkina from Cybersecurity Section A, roll number CB.SC.U4CYS25004. After coming here to Amrita, I'm realizing there's some people who made my life so much easier. Like genuinely.

1 -- Charan (my classmate)

Charan bro. This guy is something else.

He's been helping me with studies like crazy. And the funny part? I'm asking him same doubt again and again. Like literally 10 times sometimes. Same question. And you know what? He's not getting mad at all. Not even once. He just explains with smile every single time.

I don't know how he does it yaar. If someone asked me same thing 10 times I'll probably lose it but he's just so patient.

His nature is very friendly and joyful. Makes every day more cheerful and positive honestly. Whenever I'm feeling stressed or demotivated - which is happening a lot these days - he's always there to lift my spirits up. 

His constant encouragement and positive attitude helped me regain confidence and stay focused on my goals. I learned from him the importance of staying happy and spreading positivity even in difficult situations you know.

I'll always remember his inspiring words that keep motivating me to move forward in life. People like him are rare only.

2 -- Spandana Akka (OUr  Senior)

Spandana akka is honestly amazing.

She used to call me every day. EVERY DAY. Just asking "how are you, how's everything going?" Like who does that? And one day she called me and gave every reference materials on the subjects I asked for. Just like that.

I'm admiring her patience and willingness to help others without expecting anything in return. Her guidance inspired me to help others in same way.

Having familiar face from school has made my college life more comfortable and enjoyable actually. Spandana akka is very supportive and knowledgeable person who's always ready to help me whenever I'm facing difficulties.

She often teaching me new things and shares useful informations that helps me improve both academically and personally. I truly appreciating her friendship, sincerity, and willingness to see others succeed.

Her presence is reminding me of the value of long-lasting friendships built on trust and understanding. She's not just senior anymore - more like mentor and friend both.

3 -- Srinivasan Sir (Our Maths Teacher)

And then there's our Maths sir, Mr. Srinivasan sir.

This man is always clearing our doubts with smile. Always. One day I asked same doubt again and again - yeah I know, I'm doing this a lot - and he explained me the concept everytime I asked. No frustration, nothing.

Meeting these three people in my intermediate level is more meaningful and fulfilling. They contributed in improving and getting great attitude from myself.

Sir is not only excellent teacher who made mathematics easier to understand but also great mentor who encouraged us to develop our overall personality. His motivational talks often inspired me to dream big and work hard to achieve success in life.

Apart from teaching academic subjects, he also emphasized importance of communication skills, discipline, and self-confidence. He's always saying things like "confidence is more important than marks" and "speak up, don't be afraid."

His words of wisdom and practical lessons had lasting impact on my outlook toward education and personal growth. He made me realize education is not just about passing exams - it's about becoming better person overall.

Sometimes I'm thinking, what if I didn't meet these people? College would be so much harder no?

When I'm thinking about Charan, Spandana akka, and Srinivasan sir, I just feel really grateful.

They all showed me what kindness and patience actually looks like. Not just talking about it but actually doing it. They shaped not just my studies but also who I'm becoming as person.

These three people made Amrita feel like home. I'll always treasure what they given me and try to be like them for others also.
